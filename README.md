#My Portfolio
A look at the beginning of my coding journey. I have come a gret way since then. But please look at the beginning to get a good look at the progress moving forward.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Arrays, and If Else.
I use a majority of HTML, and CSS in these projects and slowly but surly start to transition into more advance work.

## Optimizations
I like the pace I was at at the time. Always learning more so I will keep doing just that and I will come back and revisit all these site to improve on them and make them shine when I learn more.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned that it's not about where your at with coding but where your going what's the next thing you can learn and incorporate into your code. I learned to not be so hard on myself cause I am just a beginner and I have so much to learn and in such a limited time frame but so long as I am learning and improving and progressing I am doing a great job.
